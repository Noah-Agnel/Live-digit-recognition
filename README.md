# Live Digit Recognition with LeNet-5
This project implements the classic LeNet-5 neural network architecture by Yann LeCun for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset.

-Model Accuracy: Achieves 99.37% accuracy on the MNIST test set.

-Interactive Demo: Includes a PyGame-based interface that lets you draw digits in real time and see live predictions from the model.

## How to Run:

-Train the model by running: python lenet5.py

-Launch the drawing interface: python pygame_painter.py

## Features:

-Reimplementation of LeNet-5

-Real-time digit prediction using a trained model

-Simple and interactive UI for testing your own digits
