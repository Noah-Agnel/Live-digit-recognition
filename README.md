# First github project on Live-digit-recognition
I worked on this project whilst reading Neural Networks and Deep Learning from Micheal Nielsen. I wrote the code for the neural network following the code from the book.
The current accuracy of the neural network is between 20% and 30% (still better than 10% which would be randomly picking a digit), however I plan on improving the program to reach at least a 50% accuracy.
