# project on Live-digit-recognition
I implemented the LeNet-5 neural network design from Yann LeCun for digit recognition.
I trained the model using the MNIST database.
The accuracy of the model on the MNIST test data is 0.9937.

I also coded a pygame pop-up window to draw the digits manually whilst the model continuously predicts the digit being drawn.
To run the code simply run lenet5.py to load and train the model, then run pygame_painter.py to have the pop-up where you can draw.
